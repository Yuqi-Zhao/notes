                invite you to attend the 17th International Conference on Probabilistic methods applied to power
                Systems, PMAPS 2022. The conference is technically sponsored by the
                <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ieee-pes.org/">IEEE Power & Energy Society (PES)</a>
                and hosted by the <a target="_blank" href="http:/www.eee.manchester.ac.uk/">Department of Electrical
                and Electronic Engineering</a> of the

                PMAPS has been a key specialist conference about probabilistic modelling of phenomena and processes in
                power systems  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about-pmaps">since 1986</a> and contributed, through the international exchange of practices and
                experiences, to the safe and secure planning and operation of power systems characterised with a
                plethora of uncertainties. The importance of probabilistic modelling, and efficient computational and
                mathematical methods to deal with inherent system uncertainties, becomes even more important for future
                power systems. These will be characterised by increased uncertainties in operational practices and
                increased reliance on non-conventional, uncertain, and intermittent power electronics connected
                generation, load and storage technologies. The deterministic tools and models that are still
                predominantly used for system analysis, planning and operation will not be adequate anymore and new
                probabilistic, artificial intelligence, and risk-based approaches will be needed and put into everyday
                use.

                <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/venue-travel#about-manchester">Manchester</a>, the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, has developed from the first industrialised
                city in the
                world in the 19th century to the second most populous urban area in the UK with rapidly growing culture,
                media,
                music, sports and transport connections enjoyed by 2.55 million people. By taking part in PMAPS 2022 you
                will
                contribute to the long history of Manchester, leading the way in industrial development, this time
                leading the
                way in application of new methods, tools and practices for safe planning and operation of sustainable
                power
                systems.
