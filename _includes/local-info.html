                world over as an incredibly vibrant city, and one able to offer something for everyone. Manchester is
                the perfect balance of a city steeped in tradition, and at the same time incredibly forward thinking. It
                is world renowned for its sport and entertainment and is at the forefront of British economic and
                industrial development.
                Manchester is a lively cosmopolitan city in the northwest of England with a population of nearly 3
                million and it has an extensive motorway and rail network. It is situated 200 miles north of London and
                120 miles south of the Scottish border.
                It has an international airport that serves over 200 cities worldwide. The airport is connected to the
                city by frequent rail and tram services and it takes just 20 minutes to be in the centre of the city.
